After discussing a couple of different ideas with my supervisor, I have decided to take on the challenge of designing and developing an Android/iOS based mobile application aimed towards learner drivers who are seeking to practice their skills and knowledge on the rules of driving. The app will ask the user questions on driving laws, road signs, hazards and prepare them for the official test.
