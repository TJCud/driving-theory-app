Incidents|What should you do if you break down on a level crossing, even if the lights haven't yet begun to flash?|Leave your vehicle and get yourself and any passengers well clear|Continue down the track and attempt to signal any oncoming trains|Tell others what the issue is|Stay in your car|1|levelcrossing|Getting everyone out of the vehicle and away from the crossing should be your first priority following a breakdown on a level crossing. Warn the signal operator via the railway telephone (if one is present), and only attempt to move the vehicle if the alarm signals are not yet on.
Incidents|You arrive at the scene of an accident and find someone has suffered a burn which needs to be treated. How long should the burn be cooled for?|At least 5 minutes|At least 10 minutes|At least 15 minutes|At least 20 minutes|4|collision|A burn should be cooled for at least 20 minutes. Cool it with a cool, clean, non-toxic liquid. Water ideally. You should also check the casualty for shock.
Incidents|You arrive at the scene of an incident. Several people are badly injured. After turning on your hazard lights and ensuring all engines are off, what should you do?|Wave down other motorists for help|Pull any casualties away from the vehicle(s)|Provide sweet drinks for anyone injured|Call for an ambulance|4|collision|You shouldn't assume someone else has already contacted the emergency services, and should phone them yourself. It's also important to make sure there is no further danger. Check that engines are off and that hazard warning lights are turned on, reducing the risk of fire or further collision.
Incidents|You are approaching a long tunnel. Which of these should you do?|Turn on your full-beam headlights|Lower your sun visor and put your sunglasses on|Use a lower gear|Tune your radio to the frequency shown on signs|4|tunnel|You'll often see signs for local radio channels as you approach a tunnel. These radio stations warn of traffic, incidents, or congestion within the tunnel. Some radios have settings allowing them to automatically pick up these signals. Ensure tuning the radio doesn't distract you. Using these radio stations will give advance warning of hazards within the tunnel, preventing issues from escalating. Fire is the greatest risk in a tunnel due to risk of suffocation from smoke.
Incidents|What should you do if your car catches fire in a tunnel, but is still driveable?|Continue out of the tunnel if possible|Leave the engine running and exit the vehicle|Stop as far to one side of the tunnel as possible|Stop and walk to the nearest emergency telephone|1|tunnel|If it's possible to continue on without causing further danger, you should continue to drive out of the tunnel. Smoke gathers in tunnels, presenting risk of suffocation.
Incidents|There has been a road traffic accident and someone is bleeding from their arm. There is nothing embedded in the wound. How should you help this person?|Dab the wound with a cloth|Raise their arm and apply pressure|Pour them some water|Lower their arm and apply pressure|2|firstaid|The casualty should be laid down if possible, and the wound should be checked for debris. Use a clean material to apply pressure to the wound without pressing any debris into the wound. If you can, raise the arm above heart level to slow blood loss.
Incidents|What should you do if your car catches fire in a tunnel, but is NOT driveable?|Close the windows and stay in the vehicle|Turn on your hazard warning lights, leave the vehicle, then call for help|Turn off your lights and leave the vehicle|Leave the engine running and leave the vehicle|2|tunnel|While the best option is usually to continue driving, this is sometimes not possible. Pull over at an emergency point (if there is one), switch on our hazard warning lights, and leave the vehicle to call for help. An on-board fire extinguisher may be enough to deal with small fires, but leave large fires to the professionals.
Incidents|Following an incident, a casualty has a bleeding arm but can move it freely. Why should you ask them to move it into a raised position?|To allow emergency services to recognise them|To reduce blood flow and bleeding|To reduce the pain|To prevent them from touching other people|2|firstaid|Raising the arm above heart level will reduce the flow of blood and lessen blood loss. You should make sure the arm isn't broken before raising it, as this could lead to further injury.
Incidents|Following an accident, an unconscious injured person has been placed in the recovery position. Their breathing is normal. What else should you do?|Give them water|Lower their arms to their sides|Ensure their airway remains clear|Press down between their shoulder blades|3|firstaid|You should ensure their airway remains clear, monitoring their condition until medical help arrives. Unless there is further danger, do not move the casualty.
Incidents|You are driving behind a lorry on the motorway. A large box falls from the vehicle onto the road. How should you react?|Continue until the next emergency telephone and report it|Follow the driver and flash your lights to get their attention|Pull onto the hard shoulder and retrieve the box|Stop your car near the box until police arrive|1|hgv|Given the size of their vehicles, it's not uncommon for lorry drivers to miss seeing objects falling from their vehicles. If the driver doesn't stop following this happening, don't attempt to rescue the object. Instead, stop safely on the hard shoulder and report the hazard on an emergency telephone.
Incidents|An adult isn't breathing at the scene of a crash. To save the casualty, you must administer chest compressions. What is the correct chest compression depth?|15 to 20 centimetres|5 to 6 centimetres|10 to 15 centimetres|1 to 2 centimetres|2|firstaid|A compression depth of 5-6 centimetres is correct. Place both hands in the centre of the casualty's chest and give two chest compressions every second (120 per minute). This maintains circulation in adult casualties who aren't breathing properly.
Incidents|You have broken down on a motorway and must use the emergency telephone. What will you be asked for?|For your insurance details|For your vehicle details|For your driver's licence details|For your employment details|2|motorway|While on the emergency telephone, the operator will ask for your vehicle details and the reason for the breakdown. Whilst on the phone to the operator, you should face traffic so you can see what's coming.
Incidents|A motorcyclist has been involved in an accident and is unconscious in the middle of the road. There are no other people or vehicles involved. What should you do first?|Pull the rider out of the road|Clear away any debris|Warn other traffic|Reassure the rider that everything will be fine|3|motorcyclecrash|Warning other traffic should be your first priority, ensuring there is no risk of further collision. Turn on your hazard warning lights to warn other drivers, and ensure all engines are turned off to reduce risk of fire. The motorcyclists is in a very vulnerable position, and you should ensure that in helping them you don't put yourself or others at risk.
Incidents|How can you help a driver suffering from shock?|Ask who is at fault for causing the accident|Reassure them|Give them a warm, sugary drink|Offer a cigarette|2|firstaid|You should call the emergency services to come and help, then reassure the driver, staying with them until the emergency services arrive. The casualty may have injuries that aren't visible, so avoid moving them unless there is further danger.
Incidents|In which circumstances should a motorcyclist's helmet be removed following a crash?|Only if absolutely necessary|Immediately, unless they are visibly in shock|When the motorcyclist asks|Immediately|1|motorcyclecrash|You should not remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is absolutely necessary. Doing so could cause further injury, and they may be suffering from shock. Reassure them with confidence that they will be okay, but don’t let them eat.
Incidents|There has been an accident involving a motorcyclist. The motorcyclist is unconscious and is lying in the middle of the road. Traffic has stopped and doesn't pose a threat. How should you help?|Remove their safety jacket|Lift them off the road|Call for medical help|Remove their helmet|3|motorcyclecrash|You should call the emergency services to ensure the motorcyclist gets medical attention as soon as possible. If you cannot phone them yourself, ask someone nearby to do it. You should not move a casualty or remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is entirely necessary.
Incidents|Which of these is an appropriate time to use your hazard warning lights?|When driving at night without headlights|If you need to stop and are temporarily obstructing traffic|While travelling slowly to read road signs|When parking on double-yellow lines|2|hazardlights|Unless being used to warn traffic behind of a hazard or obstruction ahead on a motorway or unrestricted dual carriageway, hazard warning lights should not be used while moving. They should not be used to warn of illegal or dangerous parking.
Incidents|What should you do if a warning light comes on while driving?|Deal with it later|Continue if there are no visible issues|Have the issue looked into as soon as safely possible|Hope the issue will resolve itself|3|warningdashlight|Warning lights tell you of engine faults and other problems. You should be able to identify any warning light that comes on because they can indicate problems that make your car unsafe to drive. Get a qualified mechanic to check the problem if you're unsure.
Incidents|If a car is displaying a 'help' pennant, what does it mean?|The driver is more than likely a disabled person|The driver is a rescue patrol officer|The driver is qualified in first aid|The driver is from another country|1|help|In the event that a disabled driver can't walk to an emergency phone following a breakdown, the best course of action is for them to stay in their vehicle, turn on their hazard warning lights, and await help. The 'help' pennant indicates when a disabled driver needs assistance.
Incidents|What must you do if you damage a garden wall with your car, but no one sees?|Report the collision to the police within 24 hours|Tell your insurance company later that day|Tell the owners of the house the next day|Tell someone in the neighbourhood what happened|1|collision|You should report the collision to the police as soon as possible, and never later than 24 hours afterwards.
Incidents|You are driving through a tunnel when the traffic ahead slows down and stops. What should you do?|Leave only a small space between you and the vehicle in front|Ignore any signage in the tunnel|If possible, make a U-turn and exit the tunnel|Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you|4|tunnel|Keeping a safe gap between you and the vehicle in front is important, even when moving slowly or stopped in a queue. In a tunnel, leaving space is important for the usual safety reasons, but will also help if you need to manoeuvre around a broken down vehicle.
Incidents|Following an incident, a small child isn't breathing. You need to administer CPR which include giving rescue breaths. How should you breathe into the child's mouth?|Gently|Heavily|Rapidly|Sharply|1|firstaid|Children and infants have more delicate ribcages than adults, so, after checking their airway is clear, you should use a single hand on their chest (just two fingers for an infant) when giving chest compressions. You should also begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, breathing gently until they're able to breathe.
Incidents|What should you do if you break down in a tunnel?|Stand behind your vehicle and wave traffic past|Stay near your vehicle and warn oncoming traffic|Turn on your hazard warning lights, then call for help|Call the police and stay in your vehicle|3|tunnel|You should turn on your hazard warning lights and call for help. In a tunnel, using an emergency telephone usually gets the breakdown sorted sooner. Breakdowns in tunnels can cause severe congestion and danger.
Incidents|A vehicle has collided with your car What information should you find out if someone is injured and your car is damaged?|What the other driver does for a living|Whether the other driver has a full licence|The name, address, and phone number of the other driver|Where the other driver was going|3|collision|You should find out the name and address of other involved drivers, as well as the registration numbers of any vehicles involved. The aftermath of a collision can be stressful, but you should try to remain calm. Take pictures of the scene and make note of the positions of vehicles involved. You may need this information for an insurance claim.
Incidents|Once an area is safe following an incident, how can you look after any casualties?|Give them food and water|Ask what happened|Keep them in the same position|Help them away from any vehicles|3|firstaid|Casualties could have unseen or internal injuries, and moving them could make these worse. It's best not to move them unless staying where they are puts them at further risk.
Incidents|A collision has taken place in front of you. What is the first thing you should do to help an injured person lying in the middle of a busy road?|Warn other traffic|Roll them into the recovery position|Keep them warm|Check to see if they're in shock|1|collision|Further collision and vehicle fire are the two most immediate dangers. Warn other traffic by turning on your hazard warning lights (and by placing an advance warning triangle anywhere but on a motorway) and turn off engines to reduce risk of fire. Don't put yourself at risk doing this.
Incidents|When should you move a casualty who's unconscious but breathing?|When bystanders are there to help|When bystanders tell you to|Only if there is further danger|Only when an ambulance has been called|3|firstaid|Casualties could have internal injuries or other hidden ailments. Moving them could make these worse, and so casualties should not be moved unless staying put presents a danger. Additionally, only if it's absolutely necessary should a motorcyclist's helmet be removed.
Incidents|In a long tunnel, what might warn you of an incident or congestion ahead?|Lines on the road|Drivers behind flashing their headlights|Variable message signs|Yellow hatch markings on the road|3|tunnel|Variable message signs (usually overhead or on the walls) give instructions and warnings about tunnel traffic conditions. Keep watch for the signs changing, and be prepared to stop if they warn of a hazard ahead. Incidents can quickly spiral out of control in congested tunnels, so be wary.
Incidents|If someone is unconscious following an accident, what is the first thing you should do?|Ensure their airway is clear|Put something soft under their head|Attempt to wake them|Ask for their name|1|firstaid|Remember the DR ABC acronym when arriving at crashed where people are injured. Danger (remove risk of further collision or fire), Response (call emergency services), Airway (check their airway is clear), Breathing (check their breathing), Compressions (give chest compressions). Continue providing first aid until the emergency services arrive.
Incidents|A pedestrian suffers a leg injury following an accident. The leg is bleeding heavily, although it isn't broken and nothing is embedded in the wound. What should you do to help?|Raise the leg to reduce the bleeding|Lay both legs flat on the ground|Get them a drink of water|Gently dab the wound|1|firstaid|Raising the leg above heart level will reduce the flow of blood to the limb, and therefore reduce blood loss. Provided there is no debris in the wound, blood loss can be slowed further with a bandage or clean cloth. Tying something around the leg to reduce blood flow is not advised, as it can lead to permanent damage.
Alertness|How should you use a hand-held device in your car?|Only at low speeds|Only if you can steer well one-handed|Only on a well lit road|Only when safely parked|4|mobile|Except in genuine emergencies, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone. Doing so will distract you from the road, and increase risk of an accident.
Alertness|Which of the following is most likely to be a major distraction while driving?|Using a mobile phone|Adjusting the air conditioning|Looking in your rear view mirror|Turning on the windscreen wipers|1|driver|Tuning your radio stations to local radio, planning your route, and taking regular breaks are just a few ways you should prepare for a long journey. Avoid distractions as much as possible. Handheld mobile phone use is illegal except in emergencies, but even hands-free use can be distracting.
Alertness|How should you use a satellite navigation device (sat nav) without it affecting your driving?|Only when driving in the countryside|With voice instructions turned on|When you become lost|Programme the device before beginning your journey|4|satnav|Satellite navigation systems (sat nav) are very useful for unfamiliar journeys, but they can also be distracting. Looking at them could cause you to lose control or miss a hazard ahead. Ensure you're stopped in a safe place before attempting to input information or adjust them.
Alertness|What should you do before emerging right onto a dual carriageway?|Prepare to accelerate hard|Ensure there is enough room behind you for a second vehicle|Ensure the central reservation is wide enough for your vehicle|Come to a complete stop and select a low gear|3|motorway|You should ensure the central reservation is deep enough to protect your vehicle before emerging right onto a dual carriageway. If it's not, treat the dual carriageway as a single road, and ensure you check both directions before emerging. Not doing this could cause a collision by placing some or all of your vehicle in the path of approaching traffic.
Alertness|You're approaching a set of traffic lights which have been on green for some time. What should you do?|Anticipate they might change|Brake sharply|Maintain a steady speed|Accelerate towards the lights|1|greenlights|Always consider when approaching traffic lights on green that they could change to red. Be prepared in case they change and you have to stop, especially if the lights have been green for a while.
Alertness|While driving on a wet road, you suddenly need stop the car due to an emergency. What should you do to keep safe?|Brake sharply and apply the handbrake|Wave your arm out of the window to warn other drivers|Put your vehicle into reverse|Keep your hands securely on the steering wheel|4|wetroad|Paying attention to your surroundings makes it more likely you'll spot hazards early. This means you'll react earlier too, and can keep better control of the vehicle in emergencies. Ensure you keep both hands on the steering wheel to maximise control.
Alertness|How would using a mobile phone while driving affect you?|It will improve your concentration|It will allow you to drive more carefully|You won't be able to see as well|It will distract you|4|mobile|Even using a hands-free kit can leave you distracted. The person speaking on the other end of the phone can't see the road you're driving and won't know when you need to concentrate, or when a hazard presents itself. The best course of action is to stop in a safe place before making or taking a call.
Alertness|Before making a U-turn in the road, what should you do?|Glance over your shoulder to check for any oncoming vehicles|Signal by using or arms or indicators|Select a higher gear than you normally would|Select a lower gear than you normally would|1|uturn|Before you perform a U-turn, slow down and have a look to see if the road is clear in both directions. Ensure there is enough space in the road to safely perform the manoeuvre.
Alertness|What should you do if you get lost in a busy area?|Keep moving and open a map on your phone|Shout to other cars for advice|Stop in the road and ask a pedestrian|Stop somewhere safe and check a map|4|traffic|You should always find a safe place to stop before checking a map or asking for directions.
Alertness|What should you do before moving out on to the road from a parked position?|Pull out and then signal|Pull out and then look around|Check your side mirrors only|Check your rear view and side mirrors to see what's around|4|driver|You should check your exterior and interior mirrors to make sure the road is clear before moving off. Check your blind spots too, and be prepared to use arm signals if you feel other drivers might not understand your intentions.
Alertness|You're driving on a narrow country road and see a cyclist ahead. How should you pass?|Pass as close to them as possible|Accelerate past as quickly as possible|Only pass if it is safe, leaving plenty of room|Sound your horn as you pass them|3|cyclist|Cyclists often need to weave around potholes, and sometimes need to adjust their course to correct their balance. Allow them plenty of room when you overtake, and pay close attention to the road ahead, looking for farm entrances or driveways where vehicles might pull out.
Alertness|Why do these yellow lines sometimes appear on the road?|To make you aware of how fast you're going|To help you keep the correct distance from the vehicle in front of you|To guide you to the correct lane|To inform you of the distance to the next exit|1|trafficcalming|These lines are a form of traffic calming measure. They are often present just before roundabouts and dangerous junctions. They prompt you to reduce your speed. You should look ahead and do this in good time.
Alertness|In which of the following situations are you permitted to use a mobile phone in your car?|While travelling at under 30 mph|Whenever someone calls you|Only when safely parked|While using cruise control|3|mobile|Except in genuine emergencies, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone. Hands-free kits make phone use possible, but are still distracting. The safest approach is to stop in a safe place before making or receiving a call. Your hands will also be free to take notes if needed.
Alertness|It starts to get dark while you're driving. Why should you switch on your lights?|To make your dials light up|To see and be seen more easily|Because the street lights are on|Because everyone else is doing it|2|headlights|When visibility is poor during the day, it may be necessary to turn on your headlights and tail lights to help other drivers spot you. This is especially true in early morning or in late afternoon, when the operation of streetlamps might not be timed optimally to help drivers see clearly.
Alertness|You're driving on the motorway and start to feel sleepy. What should you do?|Stop for a rest on the hard shoulder|Drink an energy drink to get you through|Leave at the first opportunity and find a safe place to stop|Turn up the radio|3|motorway|Fresh air can help keep you alert when you begin to feel tired, but your first priority should always be using the next service area or motorway exit to find a safe place to rest.
Alertness|How should you approach this bridge?|Reduce your speed|Select a lower gear|Move to the right|Maintain a speed of 30 mph|1|middleroadbridge|Slow down and exercise caution. The bridge is narrow, so passing an oncoming vehicle may not be possible. There is also no footpath, so keep an eye out for pedestrians in the road.
Alertness|What should you do if you can't get a clear view behind you while reversing?|Ask someone for help|Open the door to see behind you|Lean out of the window and look behind|Look only in the nearside mirror|1|reverse|Ensure you can see all around your vehicle before attempting to turn your car around. Get someone to guide you if you're unable to get a good look around.
Alertness|What should you do if your mobile phone starts ringing while you're driving?|Pull up at the nearest kerb|Ignore your phone|Stop the car immediately|Check to see who's calling you|2|mobile|Using a mobile phone or a similar device while driving or riding is against the law, except in the case of an emergency. For your safety, you should switch off your mobile phone before leaving and set it to voice mail. If your phone rings because you forgot to turn it off, ignore it. When you've come to a safe stop, you can check your phone and, if necessary, return the call.
Alertness|What is a 'blind spot'?|An area that isn't covered by your headlights|The area covered by your right-hand mirror|An area not visible in your mirrors|The space right behind the driver's seat|3|pillar|Even modern vehicles have blind spots, areas of the vehicle's surroundings not visible through its mirrors. It's therefore essential that you look around to check these areas are clear when necessary.
Alertness|What should you do before stopping your car?|Check your mirrors|Sound your horn|Flash your headlights|Shift up a gear|1|driver|Before pulling over or coming to a stop, always check your mirrors to see who is behind you. Don't forget to use your indicators if pulling off or stopping by the road.
Alertness|The windscreen pillar is hindering your view at a junction. Which of the following vehicles should you particularly keep an eye out for?|LGVs|Motorcyclists|Buses|Minivans|2|pillar|Approaching motorcyclists, pedestrians, and cyclists can be entirely obscured by windscreen pillars. Take extra time to look for these road users. Don't assume a quick glance is enough.
Alertness|You're driving behind an LGV (Large Goods Vehicle). Why should you keep well back?|To slow down traffic|The LGV driver will see you in their mirrors|So you can take corners quicker|To leave space for other cars|2|hgv|LGV and van drivers don't have rear view mirrors. Remember to stay well back from them, because if you can't see their side mirrors, they can't see you. This will also help you see more of the road.
Alertness|What could happen if you hang objects from your rear-view mirror?|Your windscreen might fog up|You could be distracted or have your view blocked|Your mirror might fall off|Your radio might not work|2|rearviewmirror|Anything dangling from your rear view mirror or stuck to your windscreen could distract you from driving properly. Make sure you can see through your windscreen clearly.
Alertness|Why should you use your mirrors after you've spotted a hazard up ahead?|To see what's ahead of you|To check to see if you can do an emergency stop|To check whether you can accelerate|To assess the situation around you and react accordingly|4|hazard|You should be checking your mirrors regularly, ensuring you always know what's ahead, beside, and behind you. Doing this will help you anticipate what might happen next, helping avoid and prevent hazards. It's especially important to check your mirrors when you spot a hazard.
Alertness|In which of the following situations would windscreen pillars hinder your view of the road?|On a dual carriageway|On a one-way street|Approaching bends or junctions|On a motorway|3|pillar|Smaller vehicles and road users - pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists - can be hidden by your windscreen pillars. Be sure to move your head to look past them to check the road at bends and junctions.
Alertness|In which of the following situations should you NOT overtake?|On a dual carriageway|When approaching a dip in the road|On a 40 mph road|In a one-way street|2|overtake|Prior to overtaking, consider if it’s really needed. If you can’t see far enough, keep back and wait for a better place to pull out.
Alertness|You intend to turn right at a junction but your view is blocked by parked vehicles. What should you do?|Reverse away from the junction and find another route|Move forward quickly to get a clear view|Get out and have a look at what's approaching|Stop at the junction, then edge forward until you have a clear view|4|parkedvehicles|Buildings, parked cars, and trees often restrict visibility at junctions. To ensure emerging is safe, edge forward slowly to look past obstructions. Ensure you don't cause other drivers to change speed when you pull out.
Attitude|Diamond-shaped traffic signs apply to which type of driver?|Tram drivers|Bus drivers|Drivers of mobility scooters|Motorcyclists|1|diamond_sign|Diamond-shaped traffic signs are specific to tram drivers. However, drivers of other vehicles should know what they mean so they're aware of what the tram driver may do and what their priorities are.
Attitude|Which of the following types of road users do tram rails put most at risk?|HGV drivers|Cyclists|Car drivers|Bus drivers|2|tram_rails|Tram rails are more slippery than tarmac, and could potentially cause cyclists to lose their balance or fall. Additionally, narrow bicycle wheels can get stuck in tram rails, causing them to wobble, stop, or lose their balance.
Attitude|You want to turn right in a one-way street that has two lanes. Which lane should you use?|The right-hand lane|You can't turn right in a one-way street|The left-hand lane|Either lane|1|sign_oneway|When turning right on a one-way street, you should position yourself in the right-hand lane. This way, anyone not turning can pass on your left. Ensure you indicate in good time, and switch lanes early to let everyone know your intentions.
Attitude|When driving at night towards oncoming traffic, which lights should you use on a national speed limit road?|Dipped headlights|Fog lights|Full-beam headlights|Sidelights only|1|headlights|Full-beam headlights can dazzle other drivers. Only use them when you're sure other road users won't be dazzled.
Attitude|What should you do when following another vehicle at night on an unlit road?|Turn off your lights|Use dipped headlights|Flash your headlights periodically|Turn on your full-beam headlights|2|headlights|The drivers of vehicles ahead could be dazzled if you drive behind them with your full-beam headlights on. Ensure your lights are dipped when following other vehicles at night, and leave an amount of space appropriate for the conditions
Attitude|You're being followed closely by a driver who is trying to overtake you. How should you react?|Accelerate to get away from them|Move towards the car in front, giving the overtaking driver nowhere to go|Wave at the overtaking driver to give them permission to pass|Maintain your course and speed, allowing them to overtake|4|overtaking_car|Responding incorrectly to impatient drivers can cause hazards and collisions. You should maintain your course and allow the driver behind to overtake. Slow down if necessary.
Attitude|Why is a loose filler cap on your fuel tank dangerous?|It could leak fuel, making the road slippery|The engine might not start|Your vehicle's exhaust emissions will increase|Your vehicle will be less efficient|1|fuelcap|An improperly secured filler cap can cause fuel to spill, usually at junctions, roundabouts, and on bends. Spilled fuel makes the road surface slippery. This is especially true during long periods of dry weather, when there's been no rain to wash away previous spills.
Attitude|Why shouldn't you follow this vehicle too closely?|You will use more fuel|Your windscreen might fog up|Your view ahead will be reduced, and the lorry driver won't see you|You will be distracted by words on the rear doors|3|hgv|Maintaining your distance will give you a better view of the road ahead. This will allow you to see any potential hazards and give you more time to respond.
Attitude|An LGV (Large Goods Vehicle) carrying a heavy load intends to overtake you, but is taking a long time to do so. How should you react?|Maintain your speed|Slow down to let them pass|Exit at the next junction|Speed up to get ahead|2|hgv|A long lorry carrying a heavy load will take longer to pass you than a car, particularly if the road is uphill. Enable the lorry to pass by slowing down.
Attitude|Why shouldn't you gesture people to cross, by waving or otherwise, at pedestrian crossings?|Another vehicle may be endangering them|They might think you're making a rude gesture|It will increase your journey time|They may not all be ready to cross|1|default|Reduce your speed and get ready to stop if you see people waiting at a pedestrian crossing. Don't prompt them to cross the road by gesturing to them. This could be potentially dangerous as other drivers may not be able to stop in time if they fail to see the pedestrians.
Attitude|Which driving style increases risk for all road users?|Competitive|Defensive|Responsible|Considerate|1|default|Questioning the actions of other road users is defensive driving, and can help you predict possible hazards and react accordingly. The opposite driving style is competitive driving. This increases the risk of collision for all other nearby road users.
Attitude|You are in slow-moving traffic. What action should you take if the driver behind you is too close?|Slow down further|Ignore them and continue as you were|Move towards the centre of the road to prevent them passing|Indicate left and wave for them to pass you|1|traffic|Drivers following too closely increases the risk of collision, as there's less time for them to brake if you suddenly need to stop. The best thing to do is slow down, increasing the gap in front of you. Doing this lessens the odds that you'll have to stop suddenly, giving you more space to brake in case of a hazard. This is an example of defensive driving.
Attitude|What is 'tailgating'?|Keeping rear fog lights on even in broad daylight|Reverse parking|Opening the boot or rear door of a car|Driving too closely behind another vehicle|4|default|When a driver or rider follows the vehicle in front of them too closely, it is referred to as 'tailgating.' It's unsafe because it limits their view of the road ahead. It leaves no room for error if the vehicle in front of them unexpectedly slows down or stops. Tailgating is often the primary cause of rear-end accidents and pile-ups.
Attitude|How should you deal with an unmarked junction?|Stop the car, get out and have a look|Accelerate quickly through the junction|Accelerate, looking left and right quickly|Slow down or stop, then look both ways|4|unmarked_junction|You should be cautious at unmarked junctions, especially where obstructions - such as hedges, parked cars, and buildings - block your view. In summer months, foliage may have grown to obstruct your view further, so take extra care.
Attitude|You're driving behind a vehicle on a wet road. What time gap should you leave between your vehicle and the one you're following?|One second|Two seconds|Three seconds|Four seconds|4|wetroad|The grip of your tyres on the road will be reduced by water. In rainy weather, the two-second safe separation gap should be increased to four seconds.
Attitude|When should you use the 'two-second' rule in dry, good conditions?|When ensuring there is enough distance between you and the car in front|When approaching traffic lights on green|When switching lanes|When your vehicle has stalled|1|default|The 'two-second rule' can be used to judge the distance between you and the vehicle in front in good conditions. Look ahead for a fixed object - road markings or signs, for example - and begin saying this phrase when the vehicle ahead passes it: 'Only a fool breaks the two-second rule.' This phrase takes two seconds to say, so if you're unable to finish it before passing the object, you're too close.

What should you do?|Flag down another driver to help|Use the nearest emergency telephone|Change the wheel yourself, but be careful|Change the wheel, but only if you have a passenger to help|2|default|Do not attempt to repair the puncture or replace the tyre. You should get out of your vehicle, leaving it as far to the left of the hard shoulder as possible, and walk to the nearest emergency telephone on your side of the road. Phone for help, then return to your car. Stand away from your vehicle and the carriageway, facing up the road to spot any approaching hazards.
Motorway rules|What should you do if signs above every motorway lane show flashing red lights?|Stop and wait|Slow down but continue|Move onto the hard shoulder|Take the next exit|1|default|This indicates that all lanes of the motorway are closing, usually as a result of a major hazard up ahead. You should come to a stop and wait until told to continue. Avoid changing lanes or using the hard shoulder unless there is an emergency.
Motorway rules|Where should you stop to rest if you start to feel tired on a motorway?|Anywhere on the central reservation|At the next services|Anywhere on the hard shoulder|On the next slip road|2|motorway|You should always plan long journeys with frequent breaks in mind to prevent tiredness. If you find yourself feeling drowsy while driving, stop at the nearest service area, or at the next exit, and find a safe place to stop. Do not stop on the carriageway or hard shoulder. The hard shoulder should only be used in emergencies, when you're signalled to top there by a police officer, or when indicated to drive there on smart motorways.
Motorway rules|When is it permitted for cars towing trailers to use the right lane on a motorway?|When large vehicles are in the left and centre lanes|Only when they can drive fast enough|Only in slow moving traffic|When other lanes are closed|4|default|Vehicles towing trailers or caravans are not usually permitted to use the right-most lane, but may do so when all other lanes are closed.
Motorway rules|You are in the left lane of a motorway. How should you react to traffic joining from the left?|Move into the lane on your right|Turn on your hazard warning lights|Speed up to pass them|Maintain your speed, it's your right of way|1|default|Have joining traffic in mind whenever you're on the motorway approaching a slip road. If it is safe to do so, move into the next lane on the right, making more space in the left-hand lane. This makes it easier for others to join the motorway.
Motorway rules|What is a motorway emergency refuge area used for?|A safe place to stop in the event of an emergency or breakdown|It's a parking space used by police for watching traffic|Calming down in the event of a road rage incident|For the storage of emergency equipment by road workers|1|default|Emergency refuge areas are areas at the side of the motorway that provide shelter and an emergency telephone that connects directly to a control centre. If you pulled over for an emergency but that emergency has now passed, take care re-joining the motorway, especially if the hard shoulder is being used as a normal lane.
Motorway rules|While travelling on a motorway, which of these rules applies?|Unless overtaking, stay in the left lane|Do not travel at less than 50 mph|Stay in the quietest lane|Overtake in whichever lane is has least traffic|1|default|Unless you are overtaking a slower vehicle, you should aim to be in the left-hand lane of the motorway at all times. After overtaking, move back into the left-hand lane, ensuring there is enough space between you and the vehicle you've just overtaken.
Motorway rules|What does a red cross mean if it's displayed above a motorway hard shoulder?|Stop here to answer the phone|Do not drive in this lane|This lane is for resting only|This lane is for runners and cyclists only|2|motorway_overhead2|A red cross above the hard shoulder tells you it is not being used as a running lane and is available for emergencies and breakdowns only. These red crosses will only be present in motorways with active traffic management systems, since these sometimes use the hard shoulder as a running lane.
Motorway rules|When is it permitted to stop on a hard shoulder?|When you are drowsy and need a rest|To answer your phone|In the event of an emergency or breakdown|When you've missed your exit|3|motorway|Only in genuine emergencies is it permitted to stop on the hard shoulder. It should not be used for resting, answering or making a phone call, checking a map, or picking up a passenger. In the event you miss your exit, continue to the next one. Under no circumstances should you reverse on the motorway.
Motorway rules|Which of these vehicles is prohibited from using motorways?|Automatic cars|Double-decker buses|Mobility scooters|Motorcycles with engines larger than 50 cc|3|default|Motorway use is prohibited for mobility scooters (weighing less than 254kg), pedestrians, motorcycles under 50 cc, and certain other slow vehicles without permission.
Motorway rules|Which lane should you use well before reaching your intended motorway exit?|The left lane|The middle lane|The hard shoulder|Any lane|1|default|Signs above or beside the motorway will warn you of upcoming exits a mile before they appear. You'll only have around 50 second travelling at 60 mph before the exit then appears. You should ensure you're in the left-hand lane early to avoid any sudden movements nearer the junction, as these could cause an incident. You'll see a second sign when you're half a mile from the exit, then markers every 90 metres, starting when you're 270 metres from the exit.
Motorway rules|When is it permitted to use the hard shoulder?|In stationary traffic|When directed by signs|When nearing an exit|In slow-moving traffic|2|default|The hard shoulder is mainly intended for use in emergencies and breakdowns. It may also be used when indicated by roadwork signs, or on smart motorways when a speed limit sign is shown directly above.
Motorway rules|You break down on the motorway and move into hard shoulder. You manage to repair your vehicle. How should you rejoin the main carriageway?|Turn on your hazard warning lights and pull onto the carriageway|Pull onto the carriageway before accelerating|Accelerate along the hard shoulder until you're able to join the carriageway|Wait until someone flashes to let you in|3|default|Build up sufficient speed to re-join the motorway while signalling right to indicate your intentions. Only pull out from the hard shoulder when you're sure there is a safe gap to pull into, and aim not to affect the speed or direction of others.
Motorway rules|You're driving on a three-lane motorway. If studs to your left are red, and studs on your right are white, which lane are you in?|The middle lane|The left lane|The right lane|The hard shoulder|2|motorway_studs|Red studs are found between the hard shoulder and the edge of the carriageway, while white studs are found between lanes. Seeing red on your left and white on your right tells you you're in the left lane. Remember that green studs indicate a slip road, and amber indicates the central reservation. Bright yellow/green indicates roadworks.
Motorway rules|What would you expect to find in a motorway contraflow system?|Speed humps|Temporary traffic lights|Lanes that are wider than normal|Lower speed limits|4|default|Motorway contraflow systems almost always come with reduced speed limits. You should slow down as soon as you see signs indicating a different speed limit, and be aware that the barrier between traffic flowing in different directions may not be as sturdy as usually found in a central reservation. Lanes may be narrower, traffic may be using the hard shoulder, and broken-down vehicles could obstruct lanes ahead.
Motorway rules|How would you warn drivers behind you if you had to brake suddenly on a motorway?|With your headlights|With your hazard warning lights|By flashing your headlights|With your horn|2|default|Your hazard warning lights can be used to indicate when traffic up ahead is slowing. If you need to brake suddenly, your brake lights will warn them too. Only keep your hazard warning lights turned on for as long as it takes for others to notice them.
Motorway rules|What does this sign mean on a three-lane motorway?|All lanes, including the hard shoulder, are available for use|All traffic should move into the hard shoulder|Do not use the hard shoulder|Use only the three right-hand lanes|1|motorway_overhead3|This sign indicates that all lanes - including the hard shoulder - are open as running lanes but have a compulsory speed limit of 50 mph. When driving on the hard shoulder like this, look as far ahead as you can for obstructions, as the hard shoulder will still be used for breakdowns and emergencies.
Motorway rules|What colour are the reflective stud that appear between a motorway and its slip road?|Red|White|Green|Amber|3|default|Different coloured reflective studs are fixed to the road at the edges of motorways and between lanes. Green studs are found to the left of the left-hand lane wherever there is a slip road. Use reflective studs to identify which lane you're in in the dark.
Motorway rules|Which lane should you normally use on a three lane motorway?|Centre|Either right or centre|Left|Right|3|default|Regardless of the speed you're travelling at, you should aim to travel in the left-hand lane, using lanes to the right for overtaking only.
Motorway rules|On a motorway, where might you find a climbing or crawler lane?|Just before a junction|Just before the services|On the hard shoulder|On a steep hill|4|motorway_overhead4|Crawler lanes are often found on steep hills. They're provided for use by slower-moving vehicles, allowing faster vehicles to continue in the normal lanes. This helps keep traffic flowing and prevents large vehicles hindering progress.
Motorway rules|On a motorway, what is the left-hand lane used for?|Normal driving|Only for slow vehicles|Undertaking slow moving traffic in the lane to your right|Only for emergencies and breakdowns|1|motorway_left_lane|The left-hand lane is intended for normal driving, and you should aim to use the left lane whenever possible. Lanes to the right should be used only for overtaking, or as normal driving lanes when indicated by signals. You may find other drivers become frustrated if you drive in the middle or right-hand lanes while the left lane is empty.
Motorway rules|What do these motorway signs show?|There is a police control point ahead|They're countdown markers to the next exit|They're distance markers to the next emergency telephone|They're countdown markers to the next bridge|2|motorway_overhead5|These are countdown markers indicating an upcoming motorway exit. You'll find them positioned 90 metres apart, starting 270 metres from the slip road. If you're planning to take the indicated exit, move into the left-hand lane well before reaching the slip road.
Motorway rules|In the event of a breakdown, which direction should you walk in to find an emergency telephone?|With the flow of traffic|The direction indicated by marker posts|Towards the closest exit|Facing traffic|2|default|Marker posts at 100-metre intervals along the hard shoulder will tell you how far it is to the nearest emergency telephone.
Motorway rules|Unless signs inidicate otherwise, what is the national speed limit for cars and motorcycles on motorways?|50 mph|60 mph|70 mph|80 mph|3|default|Unless otherwise indicated by a smart motorway or roadworks sign, the national speed limit for cars and motorcycles on a motorway is 70 mph. The speed limit is reduced for cars and motorcycles towing trailers.
Motorway rules|What should you do if you miss the correct motorway exit?|Continue until you see a gap in the central reservation, then turn around|Reverse cautiously using the hard shoulder|Continue and take the next exit|Reverse cautiously in the left lane|3|default|If you miss your target exit, continue to the next exit and take a different route. Reversing on a motorway is illegal, as is crossing the central reservation. If you feel you may have missed your exit because your concentration slipped, find a safe place to take a break.
Motorway rules|On a motorway, what does it mean if the vehicle in front of you switches on its hazard warning lights for a short period of time?|Police are checking speeds in this area|They are going to move to another lane|Traffic ahead is slowing or stopping suddenly|You should overtake them|3|default|Signs above or beside the motorway will warn you of upcoming exits a mile before they appear.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do if a lorry approaching a crossroads indicates right but moves towards the kerb on the left?|Stay back and give it room|Phone the police and report the driver|Flash to warn them they've signalled incorrectly|Overtake on the right|1|default|Long vehicles need plenty of space to navigate around tight corners or junctions, ensuring both the cab and trailer make it around without touching either kerb (or other obstacles). In turning left, they may first swing right, and vice versa. Leave them plenty of space and don't attempt to pass them. What looks like a gap as you approach the turning will soon close as the lorry turns.
Other types of vehicle|You are on a wet road. What should you do if spray from a lorry in front of you makes it hard to see to the road?|Overtake quickly|Drop back to leave more space|Use your full-beam headlights|Get closer to the lorry|2|wetroad_hgv|Spray from large vehicles can dramatically affect visibility, making things dangerous. If hit with large amounts of spray from the vehicle in front, drop back. Not only will you be less affected by spray, but you'll have a better view of the road ahead, and more space to stop safely if the vehicle ahead brakes.
Other types of vehicle|Why should you keep well back before overtaking a long or large vehicle?|To get a good view of the road ahead before overtaking|In case the lorry stops and reverses or rolls back|To allow other drivers room to overtake|So you can accelerate into the overtake if visibility ahead is poor|1|default|Staying back from a large vehicle before overtaking will provide you with a good view of the road ahead, letting you know whether it's safe to overtake. You'll also be visible in the long vehicle's mirrors as you begin your manoeuvre.
Other types of vehicle|You are waiting to overtake a lorry when a car moves into the gap in front of you. How should you react?|Overtake both the car and the lorry|Sound your horn|Drop back further|Flash them with your headlights|3|default|It can be frustrating if a driver moves into the gap in front of you just as you were about to overtake. If this happens, stay calm and increase the distance between you and the vehicle in front to ensure you're driving safely.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do if a lorry approaching a roundabout indicates left but is positioned to the right?|Overtake it|Follow it closely|Give it plenty of space and keep back|Sound your horn|3|default|Long vehicles need ample space to manoeuvre, and mini-roundabouts aren’t usually designed with this in mind. To complete their turn, the lorry will have to swing out wide. Give it plenty of space and allow it to make the turn. Do not attempt to pass it.
Other types of vehicle|You're approaching a bus when it signals to move away from a bus stop. How should you react?|Sound your horn to warn it not to pull out|If it is safe to do so, slow down and let it pull away|Flash your lights to warn them you're there|Accelerate and quickly drive past it|2|bus|You should always try to give way to buses pulling away from bus stops, provided doing so is safe. You shouldn't accelerate past the bus or flash your lights to let it out, as this may give other drivers confusing signals. Additionally, while the bus is stopped, be wary of pedestrians crossing in front of it, as you may not be able to see them until they step out.
Other types of vehicle|You are approaching this lorry. How should you react?|Flash your lights at the lorry|Slow down and be prepared to stop|Sound your horn|Continue as normal because it's your right of way|2|lorry_junction|Lorries and other long vehicles need more space to safely complete turns like this, and it's not uncommon for them to temporarily use multiple lanes or carriageways. Slow down or stop to allow them the time and space they need.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do if a lorry approaching a turning indicates left but moves right?|Give it plenty of room and keep back|Speed up to pass it quickly|Assume the signal is a mistake|Overtake when it begins to slow down|1|default|Long vehicles need plenty of space to navigate around tight corners or junctions. In turning left, they may first swing right, and vice versa. Leave them plenty of space and don't attempt to pass them. What looks like a gap as you approach the turning will soon close as the lorry turns.
Other types of vehicle|Some disabled people use powered wheelchairs or scooters. What is their maximum speed?|14 mph|12 mph|20 mph|8 mph|4|default|Powered scooters and wheelchairs designed to be used on the road cannot exceed 8 mph. Those only designed for use on the pavement are limited to 4mph. Both types are extremely vulnerable due to their small size and low top speeds, so you should take extra care around them.
Other types of vehicle|Which lights should you use in heavy traffic on a wet road with a lot of spray?|Full-beam headlights|Dipped headlights|Rear fog lights, provided there is visibility of more than 100 metres|Sidelights only|2|default|You should use dipped headlights when visibility is poor during the day, such as in heavy rain. This helps other drivers see you, but ensures they aren't dazzled. In particularly poor conditions (with visibility under 100 metres), it's recommended to use rear fog lights. Remember to turn them off when conditions improve, as leaving them on could dazzle drivers behind.
Other types of vehicle|Which type of vehicle will usually be safest from side winds?|Cars|High-sided vehicles|Cyclists|Motorcyclists|1|default|Due to their size and weight, cars are least likely to be affected by side winds. That said, they will still have an impact, especially if they take you by surprise. Be especially wary as you pass large vehicles, when driving on exposed roads, and when you pass gaps in hedges and buildings.
Other types of vehicle|When towing a caravan, which type of rear-view mirror should you use?|Ordinary interior mirror|Ordinary door mirrors|Extended-arm side mirrors|An interior wide-angle mirror|3|default|Your view of the road behind will be greatly diminished while towing a trailer or caravan. Extended-arm side mirrors will help you see past the trailer or caravan, giving you a clear view of the road behind.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do when overtaking a cyclist in windy conditions?|Pass close to them|Give them more room|Overtake as quickly as possible|Sound your horn so they move on to the pavement|2|default|Small, lighter vehicles, such as bicycles and motorcycles are more affected by strong winds than cars or lorries. Wind could blow them off course. Be aware of this when overtaking, leaving them plenty of space. You should also be aware that drafts from your vehicle passing too closely could also affect them.
Other types of vehicle|What should you be prepared to do in this situation?|Slow down, stop, and give way|Sound your horn and carry on - it's your right of way|Continue through the gap|Phone the police and report the driver|1|lorry_ahead|When turning, large vehicles often need more space than other vehicles, ensuring they can turn without running their trailer over the kerb or pavement. Be patient, slow down or stop, and allow them to turn.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do when approaching a bus at a bus stop?|Be aware that pedestrians could appear suddenly|Sound your horn to warn the bus of your approach|Warn the driver of your presence by flashing your lights|Pass as quickly as possible|1|bus|Any pedestrians attempting to cross the road past the bus will only become visible as they step onto the road. Be aware of this and keep your speed low. Additionally, watch for the bus signalling to pull away, and give way to it if it is safe to do so.
Other types of vehicle|You are about to emerge from a minor road. You have space to do so, but there's a lorry approaching from the right. Why should you wait?|There could be vehicles behind the lorry|The driver might lose control of the lorry|The lorry might hide an overtaking vehicle|The lorry might unexpectedly turn|3|default|In this scenario, it's possible the lorry is obscuring an overtaking vehicle, or one approaching from behind at high speed, about to overtake. You should wait for the lorry and any other vehicle to pass before emerging, and never assume it is safe. In particular, keep an eye out for motorcycles.
Other types of vehicle|In windy conditions, what should you do if a motorcyclist is overtaking a high-sided vehicle ahead?|Stay back and give them plenty of room|Overtake the motorcyclist as soon as safely possible|Drive closely behind the motorcyclist|Drive adjacent to the motorcyclist|1|default|A high-sided vehicle will temporarily block the motorcyclist from being impacted by side winds, but the motorcyclist could be blown off course as they emerge from beside it. This is a danger for all vehicles in windy conditions, but motorcyclists are more vulnerable due to their smaller size and weight.
Other types of vehicle|Why is overtaking a large vehicle more difficult than overtaking a car?|They have different types of brakes|Their speed is limited|They take longer to pass|They climb hills more slowly|3|default|Ordinarily, it takes more time to overtake longer vehicles than it does shorter ones. You need keep this in mind when planning your manoeuvre, and ensure it is safe. Watch out for oncoming traffic, bends in the road ahead, signs and road markings forbidding overtaking, and upcoming junctions. If you're in any doubt about the safety of overtaking, don't do it.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do if a large vehicle you are following indicates left at a crossroads?|Overtake, leaving enough room|Do not overtake|Overtake, but only if the other side of the road is clear|Overtake, but only once the vehicle has started turning|2|default|The turning vehicle could be obscuring activity at the same junction, another vehicle emerging beyond the lorry, for example. Overtaking in this instance could cause a collision.
Other types of vehicle|Which of these should you do when overtaking a long, slow vehicle on a busy road?|Stay behind the vehicle until waved past by the driver|Stay back to check the road ahead is clear|Sound your horn to warn traffic that you're intending to overtake|Move closer to it, then move out to check the road ahead|2|default|You should stay back from the vehicle in front to get a good view of the road ahead. This will let you know when it is safe to overtake and allow the driver of the long vehicle to see you in their mirrors. You should only ever overtake if you're certain it is safe.
Other types of vehicle|What should you do if the bus you're travelling behind pulls over at a bus stop?|Sound your horn|Keep an eye out for emerging pedestrians|Pull in behind it|Move quickly past the bus|2|default|A bus pulled over by the pavement will block view of pedestrians crossing in front of it, so you should be prepared for pedestrians emerging unexpectedly. If you can't see people queuing to board the bus, it's also possible that the bus is about to pull away, so look out for it signalling. If it's safe to do so, you should give way to a bus pulling away from a bus stop.
Other types of vehicle|Why should you drive more cautiously in areas where trams operate?|They don't have headlights|They have no horn|They cannot stop|They can't steer to avoid other vehicles|4|default|Some road systems accommodate both trams and motor vehicles. Be wary in these systems, as trams cannot steer to avoid you, and often accelerate very quickly. Driving in road systems with trams can take some getting used to, so plan accordingly.
Road and traffic signs|Where would you see road markings like this?|At a level crossing|In an area where trams operate|On a motorway slip road|On a dual carriageway|3|road_and_traffic_sign1|You'll see these markings on motorway slip roads, and should only enter them in the event of an emergency. This is the case for any area marked with chevrons and bordered with a solid white line.
Road and traffic signs|What's the meaning of this sign?|Blind summit ahead|Steep hill upwards|Uneven road ahead|Steep hill downwards|4|road_and_traffic_sign2|This sign indicates there is a steep downwards hill ahead. Change down a gear to help control your speed if necessary, and know that gravity could cause your car to accelerate. Reading the sign from left to right will tell you if the slip is downhill or uphill.
Road and traffic signs|What does the white line along the side of the road indicate?|The edge of the carriageway|No overtaking|A hazard is nearby|No parking|1|road_and_traffic_sign3|The white line to the left indicates the edge of the carriageway. You can use this on many roads to judge your position in poor visibility. Be aware that the line will break at lay-bys, private drives, and junctions.

Road and traffic signs|What's the meaning of this sign?|No parking between Monday and Friday|You may park here between the indicated times on the indicated days|You may not park here between the indicated times on the indicated days|Urban clearway restrictions end here|3|road_and_traffic_sign6|This sign tells you when parking isn't permitted in this area. This is usually done to help keep traffic flowing. During these times, you are still permitted to collect or drop off passengers, but only if your stop is brief. Always check local signs for changes in times and operating hours.
Road and traffic signs|What's the meaning of this sign?|There are traffic calming measures ahead|Hump bridge|The road surface is uneven ahead|There is a low bridge ahead|2|road_and_traffic_sign7|This sign warns of a humped bridge ahead. You likely won't be able to see the road past it, and it may be narrow, so approach slowly with caution. Honk your horn as you approach if the bridge is particularly steep, warning road users on the other side that you're about to cross. Crossing bridges like this too quickly could easily cause a collision, and you may lose control if your wheels lose contact with the road.
Road and traffic signs|What is the meaning of a red traffic light?|Continue if turning left, otherwise stop|Stop behind the line and wait|Continue cautiously|Stop if safe to do so|2|road_and_traffic_sign8|Red traffic lights tell you to stop behind the line and wait. You should always know which light will follow next, and be prepared to act when it appears. In this instance, you'll know that red and amber follows, then green. Anticipate these changes so you're not surprised when they happen.
Road and traffic signs|What's the meaning of this sign?|No right turn|No traffic permitted from the right|The road bends right|The road to the right is closed|1|road_and_traffic_sign9|This is a 'no right turn' sign.
