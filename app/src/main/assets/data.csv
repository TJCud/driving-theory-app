Incidents|What should you do if you break down on a level crossing, even if the lights haven't yet begun to flash?|Leave your vehicle and get yourself and any passengers well clear|Continue down the track and attempt to signal any oncoming trains|Tell others what the issue is|Stay in your car|1|levelcrossing|Getting everyone out of the vehicle and away from the crossing should be your first priority following a breakdown on a level crossing. Warn the signal operator via the railway telephone (if one is present), and only attempt to move the vehicle if the alarm signals are not yet on.
Incidents|You arrive at the scene of an accident and find someone has suffered a burn which needs to be treated. How long should the burn be cooled for?|At least 5 minutes|At least 10 minutes|At least 15 minutes|At least 20 minutes|4|collision|A burn should be cooled for at least 20 minutes. Cool it with a cool, clean, non-toxic liquid. Water ideally. You should also check the casualty for shock.
Incidents|You arrive at the scene of an incident. Several people are badly injured. After turning on your hazard lights and ensuring all engines are off, what should you do?|Wave down other motorists for help|Pull any casualties away from the vehicle(s)|Provide sweet drinks for anyone injured|Call for an ambulance|4|collision|You shouldn't assume someone else has already contacted the emergency services, and should phone them yourself. It's also important to make sure there is no further danger. Check that engines are off and that hazard warning lights are turned on, reducing the risk of fire or further collision.
Incidents|You are approaching a long tunnel. Which of these should you do?|Turn on your full-beam headlights|Lower your sun visor and put your sunglasses on|Use a lower gear|Tune your radio to the frequency shown on signs|4|tunnel|You'll often see signs for local radio channels as you approach a tunnel. These radio stations warn of traffic, incidents, or congestion within the tunnel; some radios have settings allowing them to automatically pick up these signals. Ensure tuning the radio doesn't distract you. Using these radio stations will give advance warning of hazards within the tunnel, preventing issues from escalating. Fire is the greatest risk in a tunnel due to risk of suffocation from smoke.
Incidents|What should you do if your car catches fire in a tunnel, but is still driveable?|Continue out of the tunnel if possible|Leave the engine running and exit the vehicle|Stop as far to one side of the tunnel as possible|Stop and walk to the nearest emergency telephone|1|tunnel|If it's possible to continue on without causing further danger, you should continue to drive out of the tunnel. Smoke gathers in tunnels, presenting risk of suffocation.
Incidents|There has been a road traffic accident and someone is bleeding from their arm. There is nothing embedded in the wound. How should you help this person?|Dab the wound with a cloth|Raise their arm and apply pressure|Pour them some water|Lower their arm and apply pressure|2|firstaid|The casualty should be laid down if possible, and the wound should be checked for debris. Use a clean material to apply pressure to the wound without pressing any debris into the wound. If you can, raise the arm above heart level to slow blood loss.
Incidents|What should you do if your car catches fire in a tunnel, but is NOT driveable?|Close the windows and stay in the vehicle|Turn on your hazard warning lights, leave the vehicle, then call for help|Turn off your lights and leave the vehicle|Leave the engine running and leave the vehicle|2|tunnel|While the best option is usually to continue driving, this is sometimes not possible. Pull over at an emergency point (if there is one), switch on our hazard warning lights, and leave the vehicle to call for help. An on-board fire extinguisher may be enough to deal with small fires, but leave large fires to the professionals.
Incidents|Following an incident, a casualty has a bleeding arm but can move it freely. Why should you ask them to move it into a raised position?|To allow emergency services to recognise them|To reduce blood flow and bleeding|To reduce the pain|To prevent them from touching other people|2|firstaid|Raising the arm above heart level will reduce the flow of blood and lessen blood loss. You should make sure the arm isn't broken before raising it, as this could lead to further injury.
Incidents|Following an accident, an unconscious injured person has been placed in the recovery position. Their breathing is normal. What else should you do?|Give them water|Lower their arms to their sides|Ensure their airway remains clear|Press down between their shoulder blades|3|firstaid|You should ensure their airway remains clear, monitoring their condition until medical help arrives. Unless there is further danger, do not move the casualty.
Incidents|You are driving behind a lorry on the motorway. A large box falls from the vehicle onto the road. How should you react?|Continue until the next emergency telephone and report it|Follow the driver and flash your lights to get their attention|Pull onto the hard shoulder and retrieve the box|Stop your car near the box until police arrive|1|hgv|Given the size of their vehicles, it's not uncommon for lorry drivers to miss seeing objects falling from their vehicles. If the driver doesn't stop following this happening, don't attempt to rescue the object. Instead, stop safely on the hard shoulder and report the hazard on an emergency telephone.
Incidents|An adult isn't breathing at the scene of a crash. To save the casualty, you must administer chest compressions. What is the correct chest compression depth?|15 to 20 centimetres|5 to 6 centimetres|10 to 15 centimetres|1 to 2 centimetres|2|firstaid|A compression depth of 5-6 centimetres is correct. Place both hands in the centre of the casualty's chest and give two chest compressions every second (120 per minute). This maintains circulation in adult casualties who aren't breathing properly.
Incidents|You have broken down on a motorway and must use the emergency telephone. What will you be asked for?|For your insurance details|For your vehicle details|For your driver's licence details|For your employment details|2|motorway|While on the emergency telephone, the operator will ask for your vehicle details and the reason for the breakdown. Whilst on the phone to the operator, you should face traffic so you can see what's coming.
Incidents|A motorcyclist has been involved in an accident and is unconscious in the middle of the road. There are no other people or vehicles involved. What should you do first?|Pull the rider out of the road|Clear away any debris|Warn other traffic|Reassure the rider that everything will be fine|3|motorcyclecrash|Warning other traffic should be your first priority, ensuring there is no risk of further collision. Turn on your hazard warning lights to warn other drivers, and ensure all engines are turned off to reduce risk of fire. The motorcyclists is in a very vulnerable position, and you should ensure that in helping them you don't put yourself or others at risk.
Incidents|How can you help a driver suffering from shock?|Ask who is at fault for causing the accident|Reassure them|Give them a warm, sugary drink|Offer a cigarette|2|firstaid|You should call the emergency services to come and help, then reassure the driver, staying with them until the emergency services arrive. The casualty may have injuries that aren't visible, so avoid moving them unless there is further danger.
Incidents|In which circumstances should a motorcyclist's helmet be removed following a crash?|Only if absolutely necessary|Immediately, unless they are visibly in shock|When the motorcyclist asks|Immediately|1|motorcyclecrash|You should not remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is absolutely necessary. Doing so could cause further injury, and they may be suffering from shock. Reassure them with confidence that they will be okay, but donâ€™t let them eat.
Incidents|There has been an accident involving a motorcyclist. The motorcyclist is unconscious and is lying in the middle of the road. Traffic has stopped and doesn't pose a threat. How should you help?|Remove their safety jacket|Lift them off the road|Call for medical help|Remove their helmet|3|motorcyclecrash|You should call the emergency services to ensure the motorcyclist gets medical attention as soon as possible. If you cannot phone them yourself, ask someone nearby to do it. You should not move a casualty or remove a motorcyclist's helmet unless it is entirely necessary.
Incidents|Which of these is an appropriate time to use your hazard warning lights?|When driving at night without headlights|If you need to stop and are temporarily obstructing traffic|While travelling slowly to read road signs|When parking on double-yellow lines|2|hazardlights|Unless being used to warn traffic behind of a hazard or obstruction ahead on a motorway or unrestricted dual carriageway, hazard warning lights should not be used while moving. They should not be used to warn of illegal or dangerous parking.
Incidents|What should you do if a warning light comes on while driving?|Deal with it later|Continue if there are no visible issues|Have the issue looked into as soon as safely possible|Hope the issue will resolve itself|3|warningdashlight|Warning lights tell you of engine faults and other problems. You should be able to identify any warning light that comes on because they can indicate problems that make your car unsafe to drive. Get a qualified mechanic to check the problem if you're unsure.
Incidents|If a car is displaying a 'help' pennant, what does it mean?|The driver is more than likely a disabled person|The driver is a rescue patrol officer|The driver is qualified in first aid|The driver is from another country|1|help|In the event that a disabled driver can't walk to an emergency phone following a breakdown, the best course of action is for them to stay in their vehicle, turn on their hazard warning lights, and await help. The 'help' pennant indicates when a disabled driver needs assistance.
Incidents|What must you do if you damage a garden wall with your car, but no one sees?|Report the collision to the police within 24 hours|Tell your insurance company later that day|Tell the owners of the house the next day|Tell someone in the neighbourhood what happened|1|collision|You should report the collision to the police as soon as possible, and never later than 24 hours afterwards.
Incidents|You are driving through a tunnel when the traffic ahead slows down and stops. What should you do?|Leave only a small space between you and the vehicle in front|Ignore any signage in the tunnel|If possible, make a U-turn and exit the tunnel|Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you|4|tunnel|Keeping a safe gap between you and the vehicle in front is important, even when moving slowly or stopped in a queue. In a tunnel, leaving space is important for the usual safety reasons, but will also help if you need to manoeuvre around a broken down vehicle.
Incidents|Following an incident, a small child isn't breathing. You need to administer CPR which include giving rescue breaths. How should you breathe into the child's mouth?|Gently|Heavily|Rapidly|Sharply|1|firstaid|Children and infants have more delicate ribcages than adults, so, after checking their airway is clear, you should use a single hand on their chest (just two fingers for an infant) when giving chest compressions. You should also begin mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, breathing gently until they're able to breathe.
Incidents|What should you do if you break down in a tunnel?|Stand behind your vehicle and wave traffic past|Stay near your vehicle and warn oncoming traffic|Turn on your hazard warning lights, then call for help|Call the police and stay in your vehicle|3|tunnel|You should turn on your hazard warning lights and call for help. In a tunnel, using an emergency telephone usually gets the breakdown sorted sooner. Breakdowns in tunnels can cause severe congestion and danger.
Incidents|A vehicle has collided with your car What information should you find out if someone is injured and your car is damaged?|What the other driver does for a living|Whether the other driver has a full licence|The name, address, and phone number of the other driver|Where the other driver was going|3|collision|You should find out the name and address of other involved drivers, as well as the registration numbers of any vehicles involved. The aftermath of a collision can be stressful, but you should try to remain calm. Take pictures of the scene and make note of the positions of vehicles involved; you may need this information for an insurance claim.
Incidents|Once an area is safe following an incident, how can you look after any casualties?|Give them food and water|Ask what happened|Keep them in the same position|Help them away from any vehicles|3|firstaid|Casualties could have unseen or internal injuries, and moving them could make these worse. It's best not to move them unless staying where they are puts them at further risk.
Incidents|A collision has taken place in front of you. What is the first thing you should do to help an injured person lying in the middle of a busy road?|Warn other traffic|Roll them into the recovery position|Keep them warm|Check to see if they're in shock|1|collision|Further collision and vehicle fire are the two most immediate dangers. Warn other traffic by turning on your hazard warning lights (and by placing an advance warning triangle anywhere but on a motorway) and turn off engines to reduce risk of fire. Don't put yourself at risk doing this.
Incidents|When should you move a casualty who's unconscious but breathing?|When bystanders are there to help|When bystanders tell you to|Only if there is further danger|Only when an ambulance has been called|3|firstaid|Casualties could have internal injuries or other hidden ailments. Moving them could make these worse, and so casualties should not be moved unless staying put presents a danger. Additionally, only if it's absolutely necessary should a motorcyclist's helmet be removed.
Incidents|In a long tunnel, what might warn you of an incident or congestion ahead?|Lines on the road|Drivers behind flashing their headlights|Variable message signs|Yellow hatch markings on the road|3|tunnel|Variable message signs (usually overhead or on the walls) give instructions and warnings about tunnel traffic conditions. Keep watch for the signs changing, and be prepared to stop if they warn of a hazard ahead. Incidents can quickly spiral out of control in congested tunnels, so be wary.
Incidents|If someone is unconscious following an accident, what is the first thing you should do?|Ensure their airway is clear|Put something soft under their head|Attempt to wake them|Ask for their name|1|firstaid|Remember the DR ABC acronym when arriving at crashed where people are injured. Danger (remove risk of further collision or fire), Response (call emergency services), Airway (check their airway is clear), Breathing (check their breathing), Compressions (give chest compressions). Continue providing first aid until the emergency services arrive.
Incidents|A pedestrian suffers a leg injury following an accident. The leg is bleeding heavily, although it isn't broken and nothing is embedded in the wound. What should you do to help?|Raise the leg to reduce the bleeding|Lay both legs flat on the ground|Get them a drink of water|Gently dab the wound|1|firstaid|Raising the leg above heart level will reduce the flow of blood to the limb, and therefore reduce blood loss. Provided there is no debris in the wound, blood loss can be slowed further with a bandage or clean cloth. Tying something around the leg to reduce blood flow is not advised, as it can lead to permanent damage.
Alertness|How should you use a hand-held device in your car?|Only at low speeds|Only if you can steer well one-handed|Only on a well lit road|Only when safely parked|4|mobile|Except in genuine emergencies, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone.

How should you pass?|Pass as close to them as possible|Accelerate past as quickly as possible|Only pass if it is safe, leaving plenty of room|Sound your horn as you pass them|3|cyclist|Cyclists often need to weave around potholes, and sometimes need to adjust their course to correct their balance. Allow them plenty of room when you overtake, and pay close attention to the road ahead, looking for farm entrances or driveways where vehicles might pull out.
Alertness|Why do these yellow lines sometimes appear on the road?|To make you aware of how fast you're going|To help you keep the correct distance from the vehicle in front of you|To guide you to the correct lane|To inform you of the distance to the next exit|1|trafficcalming|These lines are a form of traffic calming measure. They are often present just before roundabouts and dangerous junctions. They prompt you to reduce your speed. You should look ahead and do this in good time.
Alertness|In which of the following situations are you permitted to use a mobile phone in your car?|While travelling at under 30 mph|Whenever someone calls you|Only when safely parked|While using cruise control|3|mobile|Except in genuine emergencies, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone. Hands-free kits make phone use possible, but are still distracting. The safest approach is to stop in a safe place before making or receiving a call. Your hands will also be free to take notes if needed.
